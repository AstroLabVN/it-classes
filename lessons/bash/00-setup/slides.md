# 1. VirtualBox

A **virtualization** tool — it lets you run a full operating system inside your current one.

- Created by Oracle
- Run Linux, Windows, or any OS in a **virtual machine** (VM)
- Safe sandbox — nothing you do inside the VM affects your real system
- We will use it to run **Ubuntu Linux**

<Callout type="info" mt="2rem">
Download from <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" style="color:#60a5fa;">virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</a>
<br>Choose the version matching your host OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

# 2. Ubuntu Desktop (LTS)

The **Linux distribution** we will use in this course.

- The most popular desktop Linux distribution
- **LTS** = Long Term Support (5 years of updates)
- Current LTS version: **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (Noble Numbat)
- We will install it inside VirtualBox, not directly on your machine


<Callout type="info" mt="2rem">
Download the <code>.iso</code> file from <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop" style="color:#60a5fa;">ubuntu.com/download/desktop</a>
<br>Pick the latest LTS version. The file is about 5 GB.
</Callout>

# 3. Visual Studio Code

A **code editor** — the most popular editor for developers.

- Created by Microsoft
- Lightweight but powerful, with thousands of extensions
- Built-in terminal, Git integration, and syntax highlighting
- We will use it to write code, scripts, and Markdown files

<Callout type="info" mt="2rem">
Download from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" style="color:#60a5fa;">code.visualstudio.com/download</a>
