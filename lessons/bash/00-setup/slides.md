# 1. VirtualBox

A **virtualization** tool — it lets you run a full operating system inside your current one.

- Created by Oracle
- Run Linux, Windows, or any OS in a **virtual machine** (VM)
- Safe sandbox — nothing you do inside the VM affects your real system
- We will use it to run **Ubuntu Linux**
